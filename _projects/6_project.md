  <h3 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Project Overview:</h3>
  <p>
    Developed a handwriting recognition model, achieving an accuracy of <b>85%</b>. The project applied advanced concepts from 
    Andrew Ng’s <b>Deep Learning Specialization</b> to address the challenges of recognizing sequential handwritten text data.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Key Achievements:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Model Architecture:</b> Implemented a hybrid <b>CNN-BLSTM</b> (Convolutional Neural Network with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) 
      architecture, combining spatial feature extraction with sequential data analysis for high accuracy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Advanced Loss Function:</b> Utilized <b>Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)</b> for effective sequential data recognition, 
      allowing the model to handle variable-length sequences without requiring pre-segmented data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Performance Evaluation:</b> Achieved 85% accuracy, demonstrating the model’s capability to reliably interpret handwritten text.
    </li>
  </ul>
