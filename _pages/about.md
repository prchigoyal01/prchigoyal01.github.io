Hi! I’m a researcher and software engineer passionate about Federated Learning (FL), Large Language Models (LLMs), and efficient inference systems. I’m pursuing an MS in Intelligent Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University (Dec 2026), conducting research at OPAL with Dr. Gauri Joshi on adaptive LLM text infilling and efficient inference methods. My journey began at IIIT Delhi, where I worked on reinforcement learning for vehicular planning and co-authored an FL algorithm published at ICASSP 2024 and presented at NeurIPS WiML.

At Microsoft, I honed my skills in building large-scale systems through Teams Graph APIs, complementing my research with experience in scalable infrastructure for ML applications.

Beyond work, I mentor aspiring women in tech, advocate for diversity in STEM, and lead initiatives to make AI/ML education more accessible. With a strong foundation in research and engineering, I aim to create impactful solutions at the intersection of systems and machine intelligence.
